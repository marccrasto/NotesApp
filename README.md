# NotesApp
This is a simple notes app that I've created as part of my ongoing journey to master CSS, HTML and Javascript. It basically allows the user to create multiple 'notepads' with texts and save them. This app was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I had looked at a video by Florin Pop for reference, link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&t=19s. But I changed a couple of things with regards to how he creates his app. For instance, I found it much more simpler to just collect all the text in the textarea container after the user has clicked the 'edit' button and then display it in markdown on the 'main' container (please read the documentation to understand better what I mean). The way he does it seems to be a bit complicated and not something I could understand so I simply used what knowledge I had from the previous app that I created (Todo App), and then applied it here.

Texts can be written in markdown format and displayed after markdown has been processed.
