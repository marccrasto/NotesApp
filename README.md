# NotesApp
This is a simple notes app that I've created as part of my ongoing journey to master CSS, HTML and Javascript. It basically allows the user to create multiple 'notepads' with texts. 

Texts can be written in markdown format and displayed after markdown has been processed. 

Requirements:
- VSCode with live server extension enabled

How to run:
- After downloading the files, open them with VSCode, right-click on the HTML file and then run with a live server
